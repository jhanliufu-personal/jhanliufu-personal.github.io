    Behavioral approaches and electrophysiology in understanding human sensorimotor systems have both yielded substantial advancements in past decades. In fact, behavioral neuroscientists have found that motor learning involves the two distinct processes of the implicit and the explicit. Separately, they have also distinguished two kinds of errors that drive motor learning: sensory prediction error and task error. Scientists in electrophysiology, in addition, have discovered two motor-related, event-related potentials (ERPs): error-related negativity (ERN), and feedback-related negativity (FRN). However, there has been a lack of interchange between the two lines of research. This article, therefore, will survey through the literature in both directions, attempting to establish a bridge between these two fruitful lines of research.
