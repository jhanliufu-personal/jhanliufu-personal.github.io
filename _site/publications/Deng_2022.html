    Behavioral experiments on human motor learning have yielded substantial results in the past few decades. It's been established that human motor learning include an explicit and an implicit system. However, the neural correlate for such process has never been clear. Neural dynamics approach has also yielded significant understanding in human motor planning. However, the method has not been used in studying the implicit and explicit processes of motor learning yet. The authors suggest that a very fruitful result and understanding will be possible, if the neural dynamics methods is used in studying motor learning. The authors propose several possible possibilities for a theory of implicit and explicit motor learning in neural dynamics.
