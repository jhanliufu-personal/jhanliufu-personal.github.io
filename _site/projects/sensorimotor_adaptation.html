    Humans can flexibly adjust their movements according to changes in the external environment and their sensory inputs. This flexibility has been found to depend on two key mechanisms in motor learning - implicit sensorimotor adaptation and explicit motor task learning. However, it is not clear how each mechanism independently contributes to motor flexibility. The neural correlates of these mechanisms also remain to be found. In this project, we separate the two motor adaptation mechanisms by providing distinct types of sensory feedback to human subjects under a mirror reversal perturbation paradigm (Figure 1; <a href="https://jhanliufu.github.io/publications/Xu_2023.html">Xu et.al 2023</a>). We also form theories on the neural circuits that support these mechanisms (<a href="https://jhanliufu.github.io/publications/Deng_2022.html">Deng et.al 2022</a>, <a href="https://jhanliufu.github.io/publications/Deng_2023.html">Deng et.al 2023</a>).

        <strong>Figure 1.</strong> Schematics for experiment steup and conditions. (A) and (B) illustrate our experiment setup. Human subjects were asked to reach randomly determined targets distributed radially from a starting point. SUbjects could not directly see their hand, and real-time feedback of hand position (online feedback) and feedback of trajectory ending position relative to the target (endpoint feedback) were provided but reversed by a mirror. (C) to (F) illustrate the four different feedback conditions. (C) is a baseline condition where both online and endpoint feedback were provided and not mirror reversed. (D) is the same as the baseline except the online feedback is mirror reversed. (E) is the same as the baseline except no online feedback is provided and the endpoint feedback is mirror reversed. (F) is the same as the baseline except both online and endpoint feedback was mirror reversed.
